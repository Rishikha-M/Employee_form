# Employee_Form

## Description
An interactive web application for managing employee information. This project utilizes JavaScript for form validation and dynamic behavior, while CSS is used for styling and layout.

## Features
- Input validation: Ensure that required fields are filled out and that the data entered is in the correct format (e.g., email validation, date validation).
- Dynamic form behavior: Implement dynamic form behavior such as showing/hiding sections based on user input, enabling/disabling form elements conditionally.
- Responsive design: Create a user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices using CSS media queries.
- Custom styling: Apply custom styles using CSS to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the employee form.
- Error handling: Provide meaningful error messages to guide users in correcting invalid inputs or completing required fields.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript: Used for form validation, dynamic behavior, and DOM manipulation.
- CSS: Utilized for styling and layout, including responsive design.
